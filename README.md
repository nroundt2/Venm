Venmo 6/22/17

Venmo
is a free digital wallet that lets you make and share payments with friends.
You can easily split the bill, cab fare, or much more. – From venmo.com

My friend Jade Murphy and I bought
tickets to the Kendrick Lamar Concert. I paid for both tickets on my card and
she sent me her half of the bill which was 128.45. This was the ticket price
per ticket .I paid for 2 because you have to use one card on ticket master, but
we wanted to sit together.  She reimbursed
me the amount of her ticket.

 

Condition 17 –
Inquiries

 

I verify that the application with
Guaranteed Rate has been cancelled. I verify that the only account I have with
Discover is the one on the credit report. I do not have additional accounts.

Condition 29 –
Bonus

                When
accepting my full time offer, I was awarded a signing bonus of $5000 from
Chase. After taxes, this was $3180. The company sends the award a month before
the official start date to help new employees relocate and use as they see fit.
It was deposited 5/12. I began work 6/14 which was the first week that this
could be applied to my “employee pay statements”. The HR department dated this
on 6/16 which is the first Friday I officially worked. Timesheets are submitted
at the end of the week, hence the check dated Friday of my first week in my pay
stub.

 

                This is
easily traceable in my statements as it is the only deposit I ever had for
$3180 and it’s from the same company: Chase. There are not multiple checks.
This is the same one and the  only
signing bonus I  received.

Condition 31 –
Jobs

                In 2017
I only worked for Chase. I worked as an intern (or self-employed contractor )
for Road Ready Wheels which I no longer work for. 

 

The only job I hold is at Chase. I am not self employed as
an intern anymore.
